# (No) Registration

Registration is not required,
you can simply show up at any of the activities of the workshop.

Nevertheless, as a first exercise in using GitHub (a central tool in the lean community)
we invite you to make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) modifying this webpage's [source](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020/edit/master/participants.md) to add your name to the list below.
Instructions on how to create a Pull Request will be added as soon as possible.
